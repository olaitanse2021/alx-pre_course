#README file for the 0x02-git directory in git repository

Exercise 1. Repo-session
************************
Create a new directory called 0x02-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

1. at the root of your repository alx-pre_course
2. AND in the directory 0x02-git
3. And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.
